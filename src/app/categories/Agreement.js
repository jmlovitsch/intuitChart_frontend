        Agreement for Access to Protected Health Information Between intuitChart
         and Site User THIS AGREEMENT for Access to Protected Health Information is
         entered into between The intuitChart Health System Corporation and The
         intuitChart, on behalf of themselves and their affiliated
         entities (hereinafter “IC”), and the physician practice or other
         user identified in the on-line new account enrollment page completed on
         behalf of such physician practice or other user (hereinafter “Site User”).
         Recitals IC uses a certain electronic medical record system and
         related functionality, called “Hopkins CareLink” (the “System”), which allow
         users to access certain patient electronic health records to which they
         otherwise would not have access. This Agreement is applicable in two
         circumstances: (i) to grant access to the System by a non-IC
         medical office practice; or (ii) for certain activities that have been
         approved by IC for use of the System for unique and special
         activities, where the “Site User” and “Site Administrator” is employed in
         some capacity by IC. The System allows these users to view the
         IC electronic health records (“EHR”) of patients for the purpose
         of treatment, research, care coordination, payment related activities, and
         other approved activities (individually or collectively “Approved
         Activities”) to the extent permitted without patient authorization in
         accordance with the Administrative Simplification subtitle of the Health
         Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and the rules and
         regulations promulgated thereunder, as may be amended from time to time, and
         further subject to the Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, including its
         provisions commonly known as the “HITECH Act,” and rules and regulations
         promulgated thereunder, as may be amended from time to time (all
         collectively, “HIPAA”). Site User provides or coordinates professional or
         other medical services to, or is otherwise involved with Approved Activities
         involving, patients who are or were IC patients or study
         subjects. IC believes that access to the EHR by Site User will
         substantially improve the quality of the Approved Activities and therefore
         would like to allow access to the System by Site User, and those employed or
         authorized by Site User, subject to the restrictions and other requirements
         set forth in this Agreement. Site User has agreed to use the System in
         accordance with this Agreement to improve the quality and efficiency of the
         medical services Site User provides to patients who receive care at Johns
         Hopkins, or to facilitate the processing of payment related activities for
         health care services received at IC, to facilitate research
         oversight, to assist with care coordination or to coordinate other Approved
         Activities, as applicable. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises,
         the mutual agreements and covenants herein contained, and other good and
         valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which hereby are
         acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows: 1. License for Use.
         A. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, IC
         hereby grants Site User non-transferable and non-exclusive access (the
         “System License”) to the System (i) if Site User is a non-IC
         medical office practice, to permit its medical providers (MDs, RNs, LPNs,
         NAs, PAs, CMAs, NPs) (each a “Medical Provider”), and their employed or
         affiliated administrative personnel (collectively “Medical Office Authorized
         Users”), to electronically access and use the System solely for viewing
         medical records, images and content related to the provision of healthcare
         to patients of such Medical Providers, and in limited circumstances, taking
         initial steps to establish a new medical record; or (ii) if Site User is
         coordinating other Approved Activities, to permit the personnel employed by
         those entities involved in such Approved Activities (collectively “Approved
         Activities Authorized Users”) to electronically access and use the System
         solely for viewing medical records for purposes of the Approved Activities;
         (“Medical Office Authorized Users” and “Approved Activities Authorized
         Users” individually and collectively “Authorized Users”). Site User agrees
         that IC may terminate individual Authorized Users’ access and/or
         the entire System License at any time for any reason without penalty,
         regardless of any effect such termination may have on Site User’s
         operations. B. Unless otherwise agreed by IC, Site User
         acknowledges and agrees that any hardware, software, network access or other
         components necessary for Site User to access and use the System must be
         obtained separately by Site User. IC, by reason of this
         Agreement, shall not be responsible for the procurement, installation or
         maintenance of any necessary components, and IC makes no
         representations or warranties regarding the components whatsoever. Any fees
         for the components shall be borne by Site User and paid directly to the
         suppliers of the components. 2. Conditions of Use of the System. A. Neither
         Site User nor any Authorized User shall use or disclose Protected Health
         Information (“PHI”) obtained through the System in any manner that would
         constitute a violation of federal or state law, including, but not limited
         to, HIPAA. Site User shall ensure that its directors, officers, employees,
         contractors and agents, or those to whom Site User grants access pursuant to
         this Agreement, use (access) and disclose PHI obtained through the System
         only in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and federal and
         state law. Site User and Authorized Users shall not disclose PHI in any
         manner other than as permitted by this Agreement. Site User agrees that all
         information accessed through the System will be maintained in the strictest
         confidentiality and in the same manner as Site User safeguards the
         confidentiality of other patient care records to which it is entitled to
         access, or as required by state and federal law. B. Site User and each
         Authorized User agree to implement and utilize the System solely for the
         purposes of treatment of their patients, and/or payment related activities
         relevant to their patients, or other Approved Activities, as appropriate, to
         the extent permitted without patient authorization by HIPAA. Site User and
         each Authorized User shall use the System in accordance with any network
         security policies issued by IC from time to time. C. Site User
         understands and agrees that such access to, and use of, the System shall be
         limited to that achieved through unique access codes provided to each
         individual Authorized User by IC as hereinafter provided, and
         further agrees that each Authorized User shall be prohibited from using
         another Authorized User’s access code to access and/or use the System.
         D. Site User agrees that it will implement all appropriate technical,
         administrative and physical safeguards to prevent unauthorized use or
         disclosure of PHI. Site User agrees to comply with all federal and state
         laws and regulations regarding privacy, security, and electronic exchange of
         health information, as currently enacted or amended in the future. 3. Access
         to the System—Medical Office Practice. This Section 3 applies only to
         non-IC medical practices. A. Site User shall designate one
         individual employed by Site User to be the “Site Administrator” for
         administering access to the System by Medical Office Authorized Users. Site
         User, upon request, shall provide IC with the name and direct
         contact information for the Site Administrator as well as for its Privacy
         Officer (who may be the same individual as the Site Administrator). The Site
         Administrator is responsible for coordinating with IC to
         establish, modify and terminate accounts that the Medical Office Authorized
         Users are permitted to maintain for access to the System. While Site
         Administrator may have the technical ability to assign or change Medical
         Office Authorized Users’ passwords, as part of the process for doing so Site
         Administrator shall advise all Medical Office Authorized Users of the
         necessity for the Medical Office Authorized User promptly thereafter to
         establish his/her own password. B. Each Medical Office Authorized User shall
         also complete, in a form and in a manner to be determined by IC,
         training regarding the requirements of System access and use. Before access
         to the System is granted, each Medical Office Authorized User shall be
         informed of the basic terms of this Agreement and must select “ACCEPT” to
         the terms of the online Terms and Conditions of Use, as those Terms and
         Conditions may be amended from time to time. Site User agrees to ensure that
         each Medical Office Authorized User approved for access under this Agreement
         adheres to the requirements of this Agreement and the Terms and Conditions.
         C. For purposes of this Agreement, access to the System shall be permitted
         only for such categories of employees of Site User who have a reasonable
         need to access PHI of IC patients for purposes of carrying out
         their healthcare treatment or payment related duties to such patients. Site
         User agrees to notify IC within 24 hours to terminate access
         rights when any Medical Office Authorized User is separated from employment
         of Site User for any reason, including but not limited to termination or
         voluntary separation. Site User further agrees to validate and document, at
         least semiannually, that the Medical Office Authorized Users then currently
         permitted to access the System continue to require access to the System and
         continue to be employees or agents of Site User, using the System’s site
         verification process. D. Site User shall be solely responsible for
         designating and monitoring the appropriate level of access and use of the
         System based on the job functions and credentialing of each Medical Office
         Authorized User, including requirements under applicable scope of practice
         rules. E. Site User agrees to educate all Medical Office Authorized Users on
         compliance with the standards and requirements of HIPAA. Site User
         represents that all of its workforce members have received appropriate HIPAA
         Training. F. Site User shall not grant any third party access to the System.
         G. Indemnification. Site User agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Johns
         Hopkins, its governing board, officers, employees and agents, from and
         against any and all claims, costs, losses, damages, liabilities, expenses,
         demands, and judgments, including litigation expenses and attorney’s fees,
         which may arise from Site User’s or any Medical Office Authorized User’s
         performance under this Agreement or negligent acts or omissions of its
         subcontractors, agents, or employees, including, but not limited to, any
         penalties, claims or damages arising from or pertaining to a breach of this
         Agreement, or the violation of any state or federal law applicable to the
         use, disclosure or protection of PHI subject to this Agreement. Such
         indemnification shall include but shall not be limited to the full cost of
         any required notice to impacted individuals and costs of related remedial
         actions, including the costs to retain an outside consulting firm, vendor or
         outside attorneys to undertake the effort. H. Insurance. During the term of
         this Agreement, Site User, at its sole cost and expense, shall maintain
         commercial general liability insurance on an occurrence basis in the minimum
         amount of $1,000,000. Such liability insurance coverage shall include “cyber
         liability” insurance coverage. I. Term. This Agreement is effective on the
         acceptance hereof by Site User and will continue thereafter from year to
         year unless terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days written notice,
         unless otherwise terminated by IC as herein provided. J. Johns
         Hopkins has the right, at Site User’s sole cost and expense, at any time, to
         monitor, audit, and review activities and methods in implementing this
         Agreement by Site User in order to assure compliance with this Agreement and
         applicable law. K. Legally Binding. The party accepting this Agreement
         represents that s/he has full power and legal authority to bind the Site
         User to the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement is accepted by Site User
         upon the representative of Site User clicking “Accept” at the bottom of this
         Agreement. 4. Access to the System—Other Approved Activities. This Section 4
         applies to all Approved Activities other than to a non-IC medical
         office practice. A. Site User involved in any other of the Approved
         Activities shall be the “Site Administrator” for his/her specific Approved
         Activities for administering access to the System by Approved Activities
         Authorized Users. The Site Administrator is responsible for coordinating
         with IC to establish, modify and terminate accounts that the
         Approved Activities Authorized Users are permitted to maintain for access to
         the System. While Site Administrator may have the technical ability to
         assign or change Approved Activities Authorized Users’ passwords, as part of
         the process for doing so Site Administrator shall advise all Approved
         Activities Authorized Users of the necessity for the Approved Activities
         Authorized User promptly thereafter to establish his/her own password.
         B. Each Approved Activities Authorized User shall also complete, in a form
         and in a manner to be determined by IC, training regarding the
         requirements of System access and use. C. Access to the System shall be
         permitted by Site Administrator only for those individuals who have a
         reasonable need to access PHI of IC patients for purposes of
         carrying out their specific Approved Activities. Site User agrees to notify
         IC within 24 hours to terminate access rights when any Approved
         Activities Authorized User is no longer involved in the Approved Activities,
         including but not limited to termination or voluntary separation from
         his/her employer. Site User further agrees to validate and document, at
         least semi-annually, that the Approved Activities Authorized Users then
         currently permitted to access the System continue to require access to the
         System, using the System’s site verification process. D. Site User shall be
         solely responsible for designating and monitoring the appropriate level of
         access and use of the System based on the job functions of each Approved
         Activities Authorized User. E. Term. This Agreement is effective on the
         acceptance hereof by Site User and will continue thereafter as long as the
         Approved Activities are being performed, unless terminated by either party
         upon thirty (30) days written notice, unless otherwise terminated by Johns
         Hopkins as herein provided. F. Site User shall not grant any third party
         access to the System other than for the Approved Activities for which Site
         User has administrative responsibilities. G. Johns Hopkins has the right, at
         any time, to monitor, audit, and review activities and methods in
         implementing this Agreement by Site User in order to assure compliance with
         this Agreement and applicable law. 5. Data Ownership--General. Site User
         acknowledges and agrees that IC owns all rights, interests and
         title in and to the data available through the System and that such rights,
         interests and title shall remain vested in IC at all times. Site
         User shall not compile and/or distribute data or analyses to third parties
         utilizing any data accessed or received from or through the System, other
         than for any Approved Activities, without express written permission from
         IC. 6. Reporting of Unauthorized Use or Disclosure of
         PHI-General. A. Site User shall, within one (1) working day of becoming
         aware of an unauthorized use (access) or disclosure of PHI obtained through
         the System by Site User, its officers, directors, employees, contractors,
         agents, by a third party to which Site User disclosed PHI, or by an
         Authorized User, report any such use or disclosure to IC. B. If
         at any time Site User has reason to believe that the System may have been
         accessed without proper authorization and contrary to the terms of this
         Agreement, Site User promptly shall give IC notice and take
         actions to eliminate the cause of the unauthorized access. C. Any notice
         under this Section 6 shall be delivered only via hardcopy delivered by hand
         or via courier, to the following address: IC Privacy
         OfficeLocation: Suite 3001812 Ashland AvenueBaltimore, MD 21205 D. To the
         extent IC deems warranted, in its sole discretion, IC
         will provide notice or require Site User to provide notice to individuals
         whose PHI may have been improperly accessed or disclosed through use of the
         System. 7. Investigations/Sanctions-General. IC reserves the
         right to monitor, review and investigate suspected, reported or identified
         failures to comply with this Agreement and impose nonmonetary appropriate
         sanctions. Sanctions may include, but are not limited to, the termination of
         this Agreement, termination of Site User’s access, or termination of
         individual Authorized User access. IC reserves the right to
         report unprofessional conduct to appropriate licensing or other regulatory
         authorities. Site User agrees to cooperate with IC in order to
         investigate adequately complaints received involving the Site User’s
         employees or agents. If Site User is a non-IC medical office
         practice, it agrees to have a sanctions policy, produce it upon request, and
         discipline its employees or agents for all breaches involving IC
         PHI in accordance with HIPAA. Site User understands that lack of adherence
         to this section allows IC immediately to terminate this Agreement
         and all associated access privileges. 8. Termination-General. IC
         may terminate this Agreement, and Site User’s and all Authorized Users’
         access to the System, at any time with or without cause, without any
         obligation or liability for such termination. Such termination may be
         immediate in the event IC determines that Site User, or Site
         User’s directors, officers, employees, contractors or agents have violated a
         material provision of this Agreement. 9. No Warranty-General. No warranties
         are given by IC as to the completeness, accuracy or otherwise of
         the information that may be accessed through the System, nor as to the
         continuity, availability, characteristics, functionality or performance of
         the System. The System is provided “as is.” 10. Limitation of
         Liability-General. In no event will IC be liable to any party for
         (i) any special, direct, indirect, punitive, incidental or consequential
         damages or any other damages, even if IC has been advised of the
         possibility of such damages, arising in any way from or in connection with
         the availability, use, reliance on, or performance of the System; provision
         of or failure to provide the System; loss of data; access or inability to
         access or use the System or use and reliance on information or content
         available on or through the System; or (ii) any claim attributable to
         errors, omissions, or other dysfunction in, or destructive properties of,
         arising out of or in connection with the use or performance of the System.
         11. Miscellaneous-General. A. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes
         the entire agreement between the parties regarding access to the System, and
         supersedes all prior oral or written agreements, commitments or
         understandings concerning the matters provided for herein. B. Independent
         Parties. IC, on the one hand, and Site User and its Authorized
         Users, on the other hand, are independent parties and this Agreement does
         not create a partnership, joint venture or any other type of legal
         relationship other than a contractual relationship in accordance with the
         terms of this Agreement. C. No Assignment. This Agreement, and the
         permissions and license provide herein, may not be assigned by Site User.
         D. Severability. This Agreement must be interpreted as a whole; no portions
         of this Agreement may be severed from the remaining provisions of this
         Agreement. If this Agreement is determined to be invalid by a court of
         competent jurisdiction, then the rights and privileges granted Site User
         hereunder shall terminate immediately. E. Amendment. This Agreement may be
         modified from time to time by IC by subsequent versions that may
         be made available through System functionality. The provisions in this
         Agreement may not be modified by Site User by any attachment, letter
         agreement or other communication or vehicle. F. Governing Law. The parties’
         rights or obligations under this Agreement will be construed in accordance
         with, and any claim or dispute relating thereto will be governed by, the
         laws of the State of Maryland. G. Waiver. Neither the waiver by Johns
         Hopkins of a breach of or a default under any of the provisions of this
         Agreement, nor the failure of IC, on one or more occasions, to
         enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement or to exercise any right or
         privilege hereunder, will thereafter be construed as a waiver of any
         subsequent breach or default of a similar nature, or as a waiver of any of
         such provisions, rights or privileges hereunder. H. Survival. The
         obligations to maintain the confidentiality of PHI obtained under this
         Agreement in accordance with applicable law by Site User and all Authorized
         Users are not limited or extinguished by termination of this Agreement. The
         obligation for indemnification provided under Section 3 of this Agreement
         shall survive termination of this Agreement. Site User on behalf of a
         non-IC medical office practice has caused this Agreement to be
         duly executed on the day and year Accepted by Site User. Site User on behalf
         of other Approved Activities agrees to perform the applicable tasks and
         responsibilities as set forth above on the day and year Accepted by Site
         User."
